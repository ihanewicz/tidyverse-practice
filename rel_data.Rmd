## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Now my relational data notes
mutating joins: add new variables to one df from matching observations in the other
filtering joins: filter observations from one df based on whether or not they match observations in another df

13.2.1
2) the column faa in airports is a foreign key of the weather column origin 

primary key: uniquely identifies an observation in its own table
foreign key: uniquely identifies observation in another table

```{r}
library(babynames)
babynames::babynames
```
The key in babynames is year, sex, name (combined)

Exercises 13.4.6
# 2
```{r}
airports2 <- airports %>%
  select(faa, lat, lon)

flights %>%
  left_join(airports2, 
            by=c("origin"="faa")) %>%
  left_join(airports2,
            by=c("dest" = "faa"))
```
semi_join(x,y) : keeps all x with match in y
anti_join(x,y) : drops all x with match in y

# 13.5.1
# 2
```{r}
fly_100 <- flights %>%
  filter(!is.na(tailnum)) %>%
  group_by(tailnum) %>%
  count() %>%
  filter(n >= 100)

flights %>%
  semi_join(fly_100, by="tailnum")

```
